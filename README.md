# Bamazon

This app is an interface for the user to make purchases. When user first runs the command, they are presented with a Welcome Page that displays all of the current/available inventory. The user is then prompted to enter the id and quantity of the item they wish to purchase. If there is sufficient inventory to fulfill the customer's order, the inventory is updated to reflect the quantity ordered and the customer is presented with the amount they owe for their purchase. If there is not enough inventory available to fulfill the order, the customer is alerted and the purchase is cancelled.
